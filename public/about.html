<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Awe Favour. I’m a passionate Frontend Web Developer who believes that design and functionality should exist in perfect harmony. I love transforming ideas into visually stunning, user-friendly, and responsive digital experiences that leave a lasting impression. For me, code isn’t just a language, it’s a creative tool that brings imagination to life on the web</p>

<p>With a strong eye for detail and a deep appreciation for clean, modern aesthetics, I specialize in crafting intuitive interfaces that don’t just look good but feel right. I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I’m constantly exploring new frameworks and design trends to keep my work fresh and engaging. Whether it’s optimizing performance, fine-tuning responsiveness, or ensuring accessibility, I’m driven by the little details that make a big difference.

<p>Beyond the screen, I’m endlessly curious and love learning how people interact with technology. I thrive on collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving — from brainstorming design concepts to debugging that last stubborn line of code. My goal is simple: to build digital experiences that connect, inspire, and make the web a more beautiful place, one pixel at a time.</p>
